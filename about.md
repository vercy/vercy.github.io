### Work Experience

#### 2008, August - present, Survey Sampling International &mdash; Hungary, USA, Japan
Survey Sampling International (SSI) is a survey taker supplier of market research companies.
He was hired in Hungary by a software supplier
of SSI called Nebu. He has become a part of SSI when the development team was acquired by
SSI in 2012. Please find two example initiatives below that he was contributing to.

##### Integrated Partnership
In 2012, he started to work on a program that could contact survey takers without having to
have their email addresses. He took part in the negotiations
with the third parties. The initiative has become a success and is growing  steadily.

##### Scalability initiative
The scalability initiative aims cost reduction and providing headroom for business growth.
Proven accountability guarantees him the freedom of choice in tools and methods many of which
is carried into other developer teams as best practices. His team re-architected several critical
software components making them extensible for future needs and also hundreds of times less
resource intensive at the same time in comparison to their predecessors.

*Create flashcards, lookup Japanese words, reviews decks quickly with nLT*

A long time ago, after starting to learn Japanese I figured flashcards might speed up the process. After taking a look
around and finding no suitable tool I started to write my own...

* Uses yakugo.com to lookup unknown words
* Edit word definitions
* Create/Review decks
* Associate labels to decks to sort them

**Installation**
1. Create a folder for the application e.g.: C:\\nLT\\
2. Extract nLT.exe to the folder
3. Start nLT.exe (downloads missing components)

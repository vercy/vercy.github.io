The most basic way to store images is to store each individual pixel's color intensity.
This method is used in the Bitmap (`.bmp`  extension) format. Storing images this way
can take up a tremendous space especially if you have a sequence of images. As you may
already know there are more efficient ways to store images, just think of the other image
extensions (eg: jpg, png). This utility uses a  quad-tree to decrease the stored size of the image.

#### Application
You can also implement compression if you choose not to store color data for the pixels
of the same color. Using this method you won't have a full quadtree, and you have to store
color data at every node (though you hope to have fewer nodes). This way you can store
your image without the loss of any information. You can also choose to have a threshold
for matching the colors of neighboring pixels. This way you can achieve even smaller size,
however you loose information. The importance of the lost information is related to the
threshold. You can achieve even better performance if you use some sort of psycho-visual
model to evaluate the  threshold.

#### Theory
The quad-tree is a tree data structure, where each node can have four subsequent nodes.
The compression is based on the iterative tesselation of the image. You divide each
inhomogeneous area to four smaller areas and assign the new areas to four new nodes
in the tree. The data will be stored at the leaf nodes (each representing a rectangular
area). To setup a full quadtree (a leaf node for each pixel) you need a square shaped
image with the dimensions of the power of two (eg 1024x1024). If you do not want to
restrict the input you can divide every image into smaller subimages (eg: 16x16 pixels)
and apply the quadtree to these subimages. However not every image has a dimension
dividable by a power of two. At the edges you can choose to expand the image dimensions
to be a multiply of the chosen power of two. To avoid extra storage needs you could choose
the color of the expanded area to match the color of the border.

* Adjustable compression threshold. No psycho-visual model.

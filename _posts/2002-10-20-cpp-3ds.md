###### 2002-10-20
I ported a .3ds import plug-in for [Ümlaüt Design](http://umlaut.hu/) from Pascal to C++.
The .3ds format is commonly used for exporting from 3D Studio MAX. The C++ loader was a major
improvement over the ASCII Export format that was used thus far. The peculiarity of the project
was that teh internals of the .3ds format were not officially published so we had to rely on
trial-and-error development.

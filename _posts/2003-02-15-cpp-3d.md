I decided to enter the National Scientific Conference for Students with
a software 3D engine. Thanks to the demoscene I already got in touch with such technologies.
With the extensive help from my friends I started to create my own engine. It helped me a
lot to fully understand the way that linear algebra operates and makes up a complete system.
Some parts  of the engine were based on the 3D engine of the
[You Die](http://umlaut.hu/release/ud_die.zip) demo.

I decided to make the conference presentation with the engine itself so that nobody could
question the existence of the product. To achieve this goal I created a simple script engine
to define slides. The slides were basically  pre-rendered images, but you could place objects
rendered by the engine onto them. The interactivity of the slide player induced new
requirements to the 3D engine. I needed some advanced timing control, so that I could step
forward and backward between slides.

* Render scenes stored in .3ds files
* Load and render texture files
* Animated textures
* Render  wire-frame model
* Render to texture
* Start/Stop/Reset scene timing

This week I experimented with approaches to draw images in high dpi.
I put first because I was not sure what consequences might entail.
Apparently drawing via the floating point overrides of Graphics2D does the trick.

Based on this, the basics of the ui component had been laid down.
One side-effect of the week is some rudimentary plumbing
to be able to see the output which I included below.

The next step is add more details to the image...

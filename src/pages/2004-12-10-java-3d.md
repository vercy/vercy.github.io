I always wanted to write a 3D engine in Java. However there was no real need for
such an engine, so I decided to make a test out of it. I used the simplest/fastest
technologies for the implementation. The whole process took about 6 hours of work.
This also included the implementation of an import parser, that could read 3D Studio's
ase export. After the completion of the engine I wrote an interactive parameterization
UI for the camera.

#### Features
* 3D Studio like camera model
* Interactive model view
* .ase input for loading models
* Flat shaded rendering
* Wireframe rendering
* Backface culling

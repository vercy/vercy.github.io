After watching the 11th 'Star Trek Movie' I suddenly felt the urge to contribute to the Star Trek scene. I wrote this
application in the hope of being able reduce the gap between humanity and the Klingon culture :) The project turned out
to be a fun way of spending the weekend.

* .NET 3.5 application (not using architecture specific functions)
* Supports screensaver preview
* Supports multi-monitor configurations
* Customizable digits and glow

**Installation**
1. Create a folder for the screen saver e.g.: C:\\Klingon\\
2. Extract the screensaver to the folder
3. Right click the Screensaver file in explorer so as the explorer context menu pops
4. Select the 'Install' menu item from the list

> WARNING: Windows  does not copy files upon the right click install method

This task was to write a TCP/IP server in C/C++ that runs under Unix. I designed
a simple communication protocol and started the implementation. As I did not
have a working Linux at home I decided to make the application portable.
Eventually a few #define-s were sufficient. The demonstration of the program
was a successful, however my protocol was hacked :)

* Server: C++, Win32, Linux portable
* Client: Java
